In this project:
The webservice has name project_service.py and it is found in the project_data folder. In the same folder there's project_data.js which is 
the JS file that returns the data frame containing my data.
To run the webservice, just go to the terminal into the project_data folder and run command "python3 project_service.py" and then you'll get 
the link to my webservice. Just add /home.


In the project_dashboard folder, there's index.html which is the HTML file that generates the dashboard of my project and from there you 
can navigate through the other pages. 
To run the index.html, just click on it and it will open in the browser.
